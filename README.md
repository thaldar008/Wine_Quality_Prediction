## 🎯 About the Project

This project analyzes the **Wine Quality Dataset** from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. The goal is to predict wine quality (rated 0-10) based on various physicochemical properties such as:
- Fixed acidity
- Volatile acidity
- Citric acid
- Residual sugar
- Chlorides
- Free sulfur dioxide
- Total sulfur dioxide
- Density
- pH
- Sulphates
- Alcohol

### Key Features
- 📊 **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)** with visualizations
- 🔍 **Feature Correlation Analysis** 
- 🤖 **Machine Learning Models** (Random Forest, SVM, Logistic Regression)
- 📈 **Model Evaluation** with accuracy metrics and confusion matrices
- 🎨 **Interactive Visualizations** using matplotlib and seaborn

## 📊 Dataset

The dataset includes two variants:
- **Red Wine** (1599 samples)
- **White Wine** (4898 samples)
